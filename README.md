# Class and Inheritance

## Setup:

* Clone and set up your repo
* Run `bundle`
* Run specs with `rspec`

## Instructions

Update the code in `lib/stereotypes.rb` to remove duplicate methods by having
classes inherit from other classes.

BONUS: Add a new spec and a new class for the Irish, who say "Top'o the mornin'!"
